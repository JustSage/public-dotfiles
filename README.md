These are my configurations & tools I use and run daily on MacOS.

I'm a big advocate of mastering your tools, at least to the point they serve you and not the other way around. <br>
This lead me to a journey of exploring vim, nvim, emacs and multiple ide's with different configurations for different scenarios.<br>

There is always room for improvement! Feel free to open an issue for any suggestions or questions about
application X and it's installation process.

PS: I'm always up for a discussion about my favorite tools so don't hesitate to leave a message!

#### TODO's:

- [ ] add emacs & org-mode configurations
- [ ] add alfred workflows folder
- [ ] add resources & links
- [ ] add images of my current terminal setup
- [ ] automate a scheduler to push on a weekly if any changes were made
